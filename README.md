This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.  It consists of scripts to clean and aggregate accelerometer data for wearable devices.

This script loads the training data, the training labels, and the test data and labels.  It also loads the subject identifiers from subject_train and subject_test and the human-readable activity labels from activity_labels.txt.  It selects only the mean and std columns from the training and test data and replaces the numeric activity labels with human-readable ones.  It prepends the human-readable activity labels and the subject identifiers and aggregates by subject ID and activity label, taking the mean of the feature columns.
